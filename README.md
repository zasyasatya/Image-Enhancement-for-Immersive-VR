### _Image Processing App_


Image enhancement is needed to increase the immersiveness of Virtual Reality. In this project, the author proposes Histogram Enhancement (HE) and Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Enhancement (CLAHE) methods.


## Features

- HE implementation in batch of images
- CLAHE implementation in batch of images
- Save each histogram comparation
- preprocessing crop 
- color conversion from RGB into LAB
- Use 5 evaluation metric such as SSIM, MSE, IQI, RMSE, PSNR
- Save whole evaluation result into CSV


## Tech

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- natsort
- matplotlib
- numpy
- datetime
- pandas


## Installation Dependencies

You can install just by type the syntax below
